**Capture Tips**
- Use 1440×900 or higher resolution so labels remain crisp.
- Include the Tableau/Looker timestamp or a text box referencing the latest pipeline run.
- Save PNGs into `dashboards/screenshots/` beside this shotlist for local reference; they remain git-ignored, so store canonical copies in cloud storage or your BI tool.
